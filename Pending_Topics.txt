Explain Generators and use case of it.
A function or method which uses the yield statement is called a generator function. 
Such a function, when called, always returns an iterator object which can be used 
to execute the body of the function: calling the iteratorâ€™s iterator._next_()
method will cause the function to execute until it provides 
a value using the yield statement.

When the function executes a return statement or falls off the end, 
a StopIteration exception is raised and the iterator will have reached the 
end of the set of values to be returned. Note that a generator can 
have n numbers of yield statements

Note: You can only iterate over a generator once, 
if you try to loop over it second time it will return nothing. 
Generators also do not store all the values in memory, 
they generate the values on the fly

When you call a generator function, the code you have written in 
the function body does not run. 
The function only returns the generator object.

Can set have lists as elements?
You can't add a list to a set because lists are mutable, 
meaning that you can change the contents of the list after adding it to the set. 
You can however add tuples to the set, 
because you cannot change the contents of a tuple.
The objects have to be hashable so that finding, 
adding and removing elements can be done faster than looking at each individual 
element every time you perform these operations.

Some unhashable datatypes:

list: use tuple instead
set: use frozenset instead
